# EveryGrep

Instant file name search for Linux.

EveryGrep keeps a compact in-memory index of every file and folder name and finds
matches anywhere in a name (not only at word starts) as you type.

**Status:** early development, no release yet.

## Building

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/everygrep --version
```

Requires Rust 1.85 or newer.

## Development

Run `scripts/check.sh` before every commit. It checks formatting, runs clippy with
warnings as errors, and runs the test suite.
